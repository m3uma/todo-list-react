# TO DO LIST

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This to do list is a project developed using the react js technology. The following methods were used:
* useState
* useEffect
* useRef
* custom hooks
* Styled Components
* Global Style
* own themes
* Local Storage
* Redux
* Redux Toolkit
* Redux Saga
* React Router
* BEM convention

In the todo list app you can add to-do tasks that are saved in local storage. Mark them as done, delete them, view details about them. You can mark all tasks as done and hide / show completed tasks. You also have the option of filtering tasks, as well as downloading sample tasks to do if you are bored and have no responsibilities. The application is divided into two subpages - the main one with tasks and the "about the author" section.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
